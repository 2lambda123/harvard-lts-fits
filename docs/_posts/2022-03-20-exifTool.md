details: Exiftool is written in Perl. A windows executable is also provided. The Exiftool tool wrapper detects the operating system type and calls the appropriate version of the tool. The tab-delimited output is captured, converted to a simple XML structure, and then converted to FITS XML using xslt. xml/exiftool/exiftool_xslt_map.xml is used to determine which XSLT to apply for the given identified format.
