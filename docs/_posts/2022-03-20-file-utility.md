details: File Utility is usually bundled with Linux, UNIX and OS X. The GnuWin32? port is provided for use on Windows. Due to variations in versions this may cause different output when run on different platforms. File Utility is called in its default mode (no arguments), and also with -i to determine the MIME type. The output is converted into a simple XML document and then converted to FITS XML using xml/fileutility/fileutility_to_fits.xslt
