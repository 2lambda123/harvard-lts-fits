semantic-unit: 4.03 Image elements
semantic-components: Include accordion with list of image elements
definition: This section contains technical metadata for image files. The tools will extract the raw output of the file, and FITS normalizes and consolidates the output into the standard elements.
rationale: Each file processed with FITS should have unique technical properties to support use and rendering.
data-constraint: Container
repeatability: Not repeatable
obligation: Automatic
usage-notes: The list of image elements represents the potential properties of a given file. The actual elements depend on what the tools are able to determine for the file.
