definition: This section contains technical metadata for audio files. The tools will extract the raw output of the file, and FITS normalizes and consolidates the output into the standard elements.
rationale: Each file processed with FITS should have unique technical properties to support use and rendering.
data-constraint: Container
repeatability: Repeatable
obligation: Automatic
usage-notes: The list of audio elements represents the potential properties of a given file. The actual elements depend on what the tools are able to determine for the file.
