definition: This section contains technical metadata for text files. The tools will extract the raw output of the file, and FITS normalizes and consolidates the output into the standard elements.
rationale: Each file processed with FITS should have unique technical properties to support use and rendering.

repeatability: Repeatable
obligation: Automatic
usage-notes: The list of text elements represents the potential properties of a given file. The actual elements depend on what the tools are able to determine for the file.
