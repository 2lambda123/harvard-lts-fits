DOUBLE CHECK the below:

Element Questions
-----------------

    fileInfo/creatingApplicationVersion
        - do we need this? Not in XML sample
        - if so, where does it come from?

Element TODO (and special cases)
-----------------

    Video tracks
    
    metadata/video/track/byteOrder --> Revisit
	This is rarely listed by MediaInfo, as it is implicit from the encoding used
	? What are the values?
		? CONDITIONAL - 2vuy = unknown
		? CONDITIONAL - avc = unknown
		? CONDITIONAL - dv = unknown
		? CONDITIONAL - dv5n = unknown
		? CONDITIONAL - apch = unknown
		? CONDITIONAL - JPEG 2000 = unknown
		
		
	metadata/video/track/byteOrder --> Double Check	
		values: big, little
		
			
		
	metadata/video/track/bitRateMode --> Double Check
		values: variable, constant
		
	metadata/video/track/bitRate --> Revise this
		if bitRateMode is variable, this is replaced by bitRateMax
		
		PROBLEM - bitRateMax seems never to be present
	
	metadata/video/track/frameRate - Double Check
		if frameRateMode is variable, this is replaced by frameRateMa
	
	DONE?	
	metadata/video/track/bitDepth --> Revisit
		in cases where this is not present, it will have to be generated via lookup table of encodings
		? what lookup table???
			? 2vuy = 8
			? apch = 10
	
	metadata/video/scanningFormat --> Revisit
		in cases where this is not present, it will have to be generated via lookup table of encodings
		? what lookup table???
			? 2vuy = progressive
			? v210 = progresssive
		
	metadata/video/track/compression --> Revisit
	
		MediaInfo sometimes does not print this, as it feel it is implicit. 
		This will need a conditional check in cases where it is not explicit.
		
		? What values and how to determine?
			Lossless
			avc = unknown
			apch = lossy
